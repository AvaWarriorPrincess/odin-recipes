        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p1>
            Apple pie is an iconic American desert! This recipe takes inspiration from a few sources and some of my own spins on it!
            Key to this recipe is including sugar and cinnamon in the pie dough (giving it an amazing flavor) and making sure to liberally apply the carmel while layering the pie!
            This recipe has been lauded by my boyfriend as one of the best things he's ever eaten, so give it a go!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>INSERT DOUGH INGREDIENTS</strong></li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups Flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>3 tbsp Sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup Cold Unsalted Vegan Butter</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Cinnamon</li>
            <li>4-8 tbsp Ice Water</li>
            <li>8-9 Medium sized Red Delicious Apples</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted Vegan Butter</li>
            <li>6 tbsp Flour</li>
            <li>1 cup White Sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup Brown Sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp Cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>6 tbsp Water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Prep</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel, core, and slice your apples into thin even slices. Place aside.</li>
            <li>Add 1 1/2 cups flour, salt, sugar, and cinnamon to a food processor. Pulse 2 to 3 times until combined. The remaining cup of flour will be added later.</li>
            <li>Scatter butter cubes over flour and process until a dough or paste begins to form, about 15 seconds. (There should be no uncoated flour).</li>
            <li>Scrape bowl, redistribute the flour-butter mixture then add remaining 1 cup of flour. Pulse 4 to 5 times until flour is evenly distributed. (Dough should look broken up and a little crumbly).</li>
            <li>Transfer to a medium bowl then sprinkle ice water over mixture — start with 4 tablespoons and add from there. Using a rubber spatula, press the dough into itself. The crumbs should begin to form larger clusters. If you pinch some of the dough and it holds together, it’s ready. If the dough falls apart, add 2 to 4 more tablespoons of water and continue to press until dough comes together.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Making The Pie</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>On medium heat, melt butter in a sauce pan. Stir in flour until dissolved. Add in white sugar, brown sugar, water, and vanilla extract. Stir until dissolved. Add in nutmeg and cinnamon. Stir until dissolved and bring mixture to a boil. Reduce temperature and allow to simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a 9" pie pan, place your bottom crust and fill with a third of your apple slices. Dollop in your sauce and coat the bottom layer. Repeat the process for the next two tiers of the pie, spreading the sauce evenly over the top each time.</li>
            <li>To create the lattice, roll out your top crust to be slightly larger than the top of your pie pan. Slice into 3/4 inch slices (or thicker or thinner depending on how intricate you'd like your lattice to be). Place all of the vertical slices down on top of the pie. Then weave in each horizontal slice.</li>
            <li>Once the lattice is completed, trim the extra edges and flatten the crust with a fork around the whole pie. Set your oven to 350 degrees and bake on the middle rack. This pie should take about an hour to complete, you'll know it's done when you can stick a toothpick and puncture the apples inside easily.</li>
        </ol>
