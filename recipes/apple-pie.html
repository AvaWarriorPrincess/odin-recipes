        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8-9 Medium sized Red Delicious Apples</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted Vegan butter</li>
            <li>3 tbsp Flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup White Sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Brown Sugar</li>

            <li>1/2 tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>3 tbsp Water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Prep</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel, core, and slice your apples into thin even slices. Place aside.</li>
            <li>Make the dough <strong>insert instructions</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Making The Pie</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>On medium heat, melt butter in a sauce pan. Stir in flour until dissolved. Add in white sugar, brown sugar, water, and vanilla extract. Stir until dissolved. Add in nutmeg and cinnamon. Stir until dissolved and bring mixture to a boil. Reduce temperature and allow to simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a 9" pie pan, place your bottom crust and fill with a third of your apple slices. Dollop in your sauce and coat the bottom layer. Repeat the process for the next two tiers of the pie, spreading the sauce evenly over the top each time.</li>
            <li>To create the lattice, roll out your top crust to be slightly larger than the top of your pie pan. Slice into 3/4 inch slices (or thicker or thinner depending on how intricate you'd like your lattice to be). Place all of the vertical slices down on top of the pie. Then weave in each horizontal slice.</li>
            <li>Once the lattice is completed, trim the extra edges and flatten the crust with a fork around the whole pie. Set your oven to 350 degrees and bake on the middle rack. This pie should take about an hour to complete, you'll know it's done when you can stick a toothpick and puncture the apples inside easily.</li>
        </ol>
