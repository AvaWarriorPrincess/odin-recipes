        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p1>
            This recipe takes inspiration from Japanese style curry and rice! Japanese curry is historically based somewhat on indian curry brought by the British during the 1800s.
            This dish contains a <strong><em>ton</em></strong> of delicious flavor from the spices, and the vegetables and soy curls provide an amazing meal!
            The best part of this recipe is that it is relatively quick and makes <em>a lot</em> of Curry which is also fairly light on calories but high in nutrition!
